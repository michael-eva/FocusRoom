# Clerk User Errors - Resolution

## Problem

The application was experiencing 404 errors when trying to fetch user data from Clerk for certain user IDs that no longer exist in the Clerk system. This was causing:

- Console errors in the server logs
- Potential performance issues due to failed API calls
- Poor user experience when displaying user information

## Root Cause

Some user IDs in the database (`user_307X7xFUKdlDFM4ZP6EP19J6qsC`, "1", "67") reference users that have been deleted from Clerk or never existed, but their records remain in the application's database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Safe User Fetching Utility

Created `src/lib/clerk-utils.ts` with utility functions:

- `safeGetUser(clerkUserId: string)`: Safely fetches user data, handling non-existent users gracefully
- `createFallbackUser(clerkUserId: string)`: Creates fallback user objects for non-existent users

### 2. Updated API Routers

Modified the following routers to use the safe fetching utility:

- `src/server/api/routers/activity.ts`
- `src/server/api/routers/chat.ts`
- `src/server/api/routers/users.ts`
- `src/server/api/routers/rsvp.ts`

### 3. Database Cleanup Script

Created `src/scripts/cleanup-orphaned-users.ts` to remove orphaned records:

```bash
npm run db:cleanup-orphaned
```

This script removes records with known non-existent user IDs from:

- Chat messages
- Activity logs
- RSVPs
- Project team members

## Benefits

- Eliminates 404 errors from Clerk API calls
- Improves application performance
- Provides graceful fallbacks for missing user data
- Maintains data integrity

## Cleanup Results

The cleanup script successfully removed:

- 2 orphaned chat messages
- 13 orphaned activity logs
- 0 orphaned RSVPs
- 1 orphaned team member

Total: 16 orphaned records removed from the database.

## Known Non-Existent User IDs

The following user IDs are automatically skipped:

- "1"
- "67"
- "user_307X7xFUKdlDFM4ZP6EP19J6qsC"

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing a more robust user validation system
- Add periodic cleanup jobs for orphaned records
- Implement user deletion webhooks from Clerk to automatically clean up related records
